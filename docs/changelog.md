## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-20

First public release. Repo moved to `pixelcrafts-app/claude-craft`.

### Breaking

- **Standalone per-skill plugins removed.** Previous versions shipped every audit/scaffold/workflow skill twice — once inside the stack bundle and once as its own plugin (`flutter-pre-ship`, `flutter-scaffold-feature`, `web-premium-check`, `api-sync-migrate`, etc.). Every skill is still available via its namespaced slash command (`/flutter-standards:pre-ship`, `/api-standards:sync-migrate`) — just install the bundle. If you had a standalone plugin enabled, replace it with the bundle:
  - `flutter-pre-ship@pixelcrafts` → `flutter-standards@pixelcrafts`
  - `api-sync-migrate@pixelcrafts` → `api-standards@pixelcrafts`
  - `web-premium-check@pixelcrafts` → `web-standards@pixelcrafts`
- **Marketplace shrinks from 15 plugins to 4.** One pack per stack plus `core-hooks`.

### Changed

- Repo renamed to `claude-craft` and moved to the `pixelcrafts-app` org. Old URL `nandamashokkumar/pixelcrafts` replaced across all files.
- `scripts/sync.sh` removed — no longer needed without standalone plugins.
- `core/hooks/` (dead duplicate) removed. Real hooks live in `core/plugins/core-hooks/hooks/`.
- `docs/history.md` removed — internal provenance not useful for public consumers.

### Infrastructure

- All plugin versions bumped to `0.2.0` in lockstep.
- README rewritten for public launch.
- Quickstart, skills, contributing docs rewritten.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-20

### Changed

- **Agents now load companion standards on invocation.** All 5 agents (`api-standards`: security-reviewer, api-documenter; `flutter-standards`: flutter-reviewer, security-reviewer, test-writer) prepend a Standards Context block instructing Claude to Glob + Read the companion `SKILL.md` files before auditing. Previous behavior: agents ran with only their own checklist and didn't reference the auto-invoke standards in the same plugin.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-20

Initial internal release. Three stack packs plus cross-stack safety, with multi-tool export.

### Flutter pack — `flutter-standards`

9 auto-invoke standards (craft-guide, engineering, widget-rules, api-data, testing, accessibility, performance, forms, observability).

8 explicit audit/scaffold skills accessible via `/flutter-standards:<skill>`:
- pre-ship, premium-check, verify-screens, find-hardcoded, find-duplicates, accessibility-audit, scaffold-screen, scaffold-feature

3 agents: flutter-reviewer, test-writer, security-reviewer.

### API pack — `api-standards`

2 auto-invoke standards: nestjs, code-quality.

1 explicit workflow: `/api-standards:sync-migrate`.

2 agents: api-documenter, security-reviewer.

### Web pack — `web-standards`

1 auto-invoke standard: nextjs.

2 explicit skills: `/web-standards:pre-ship`, `/web-standards:premium-check`.

### Safety — `core-hooks`

Cross-stack PreToolUse hooks (`protect-files.sh`, `protect-bash.sh`).

### Distribution

- Zero-config install via `.claude/settings.json`
- Multi-tool export via `scripts/export.sh` for Cursor + AGENTS.md consumers
