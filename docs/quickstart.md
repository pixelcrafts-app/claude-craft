# Quickstart

From zero to standards-applied in under two minutes.

## What you need

- A project — Flutter, NestJS + Prisma API, or Next.js web
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (any form — CLI, desktop, IDE extension). Or Cursor, Antigravity, Codex, Aider — the [export script](#use-with-cursor-antigravity-codex-aider) covers them.

---

## Path 1 — Zero-config (recommended for teams)

Commit `.claude/settings.json` to your project:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "pixelcrafts": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "pixelcrafts-app/claude-craft" }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "flutter-standards@pixelcrafts": true,
    "core-hooks@pixelcrafts": true
  }
}
```

Teammates who open the project in Claude Code auto-install on first session — no commands, no onboarding doc.

Swap the pack to match the project:

| Project | `enabledPlugins` entry |
|---|---|
| Flutter | `flutter-standards@pixelcrafts` |
| NestJS + Prisma | `api-standards@pixelcrafts` |
| Next.js | `web-standards@pixelcrafts` |

Always include `core-hooks@pixelcrafts` — the cross-stack safety net (blocks secret edits + dangerous shell commands) plus the `docs-sync` skill that catches code-vs-docs drift at end-of-task moments.

---

## Path 2 — Slash commands (one-off install)

```
/plugin marketplace add pixelcrafts-app/claude-craft
/plugin install flutter-standards@pixelcrafts
/plugin install core-hooks@pixelcrafts
```

To pull later updates: `/plugin marketplace update pixelcrafts`.

---

## First run — see it work

Once installed, open a file matching your pack:
- Flutter → any `.dart` in `lib/`
- API → any `.ts` in `src/`
- Web → any `.tsx` in `app/` or `components/`

Ask Claude to build or review something in that file. The auto-invoke standards fire on their own — you don't cite, import, or enable anything.

**Try an audit (Flutter):**
```
/flutter-standards:find-hardcoded
```

Sample output:
```
Design System Violations
Scope: lib/   Scanned: 127 files   Violations: 184

Colors (73)
  lib/features/home/card.dart:24
    Color(0xFF3A6FE0) → AppColors.primary

Spacing (48)
  lib/features/onboarding/welcome.dart:32
    EdgeInsets.all(16) → EdgeInsets.all(AppSpacing.md)
```

**Try a scaffold:**
```
/flutter-standards:scaffold-feature bookmarks --with-api --with-persistence
```

Generates model, mapper, repository, remote + local data sources, providers, screen with loading / empty / error / content states wired, widgets, test stubs, and a feature README.

**Run the full quality gate before merging:**
```
/flutter-standards:pre-ship
```

## What each pack gives you

### Flutter (`flutter-standards`)

10 auto-invoke standards (craft-guide, engineering, widget-rules, api-data, testing, accessibility, performance, forms, observability, production-readiness).

Slash commands:
- `/flutter-standards:pre-ship` — quality gate before merge
- `/flutter-standards:premium-check` — craft review of a screen
- `/flutter-standards:verify-screens` — trace data source → UI
- `/flutter-standards:find-hardcoded` — scan for design-system violations
- `/flutter-standards:find-duplicates` — scan for DRY violations
- `/flutter-standards:accessibility-audit` — 10 a11y patterns
- `/flutter-standards:scaffold-screen` — generate screen with 4 states
- `/flutter-standards:scaffold-feature` — generate feature folder

Agents: `flutter-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`, `test-writer`.

### API (`api-standards`)

Auto-invoke: `nestjs`, `code-quality`.

Slash command: `/api-standards:sync-migrate` — Prisma schema change workflow, reminds you to sync downstream consumers.

Agents: `api-documenter`, `security-reviewer`.

### Web (`web-standards`)

Auto-invoke: `nextjs`, `production-readiness`, `craft-guide` (17-section universal design formulas — color, spacing, type, shadow/radius, motion, state, responsive, aesthetic coherence, iconography, chrome, a11y, theme, microcopy, brand moments; enforces discipline, never picks brand values).

Slash commands:
- `/web-standards:pre-ship` — quality gate before merge
- `/web-standards:premium-check` — 17-section iteration-loop craft audit (rule-by-rule PASS/FAIL, loops to zero)
- `/web-standards:extract-tokens` — establish `design-tokens.md` as single source of truth
- `/web-standards:theme-audit` — light/dark parity, hydration flash, switch coverage
- `/web-standards:aesthetic-coherence` — flag mixed design languages in one surface

### Safety + Docs-sync (`core-hooks`)

- PreToolUse hooks block edits to `.env`/secret files and dangerous shell commands (`rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`). No commands — runs on every edit.
- Auto-invoke `docs-sync` skill catches drift between code and docs at end-of-task moments (version bumps, new skills, "ship / done / release"). Flags deltas; never rewrites prose; never blocks.

## Use with Cursor, Antigravity, Codex, Aider

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pixelcrafts-app/claude-craft
./claude-craft/scripts/export.sh /path/to/your-project flutter
```

Generates:
- `.cursor/rules/flutter-*.mdc` — Cursor Rules v2 (one per standards skill, scoped to `lib/**/*.dart`)
- `AGENTS.md` — concatenated standards for Antigravity, Codex, Aider, OpenAI SWE

Packs: `flutter`, `api`, `web`. Re-run when you want the latest.

## Multi-project / monorepo sessions

If you work across several projects that live under one parent folder (e.g. `my-org/api`, `my-org/web`, `my-org/mobile`), open Claude Code from the **parent folder** — not from a child — if you want cross-project edits to honor every pack's standards and hooks.

**Why:** Claude Code loads `.claude/settings.json` from the directory it's opened in. Plugins and hooks are bound to that scope. `--add-dir` grants file access to a sibling project but does **not** merge that project's `.claude/settings.json`. So editing a `.dart` file from a session rooted in your web project won't auto-invoke Flutter standards or run the dart-format hook.

**Pattern that works:**

1. Commit a parent-level `./.claude/settings.json` that enables every pack you need and declares path-aware hooks (dispatch by file extension). Example:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "pixelcrafts": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "pixelcrafts-app/claude-craft" }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "flutter-standards@pixelcrafts": true,
    "api-standards@pixelcrafts": true,
    "web-standards@pixelcrafts": true,
    "core-hooks@pixelcrafts": true
  },
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [{
          "type": "command",
          "command": "filepath=$(jq -r '.tool_response.filePath // .tool_input.file_path // empty'); case \"$filepath\" in *.ts|*.tsx|*.js|*.jsx|*.json|*.md) dir=$(dirname \"$filepath\"); while [ \"$dir\" != \"/\" ] && [ ! -f \"$dir/package.json\" ]; do dir=$(dirname \"$dir\"); done; [ -x \"$dir/node_modules/.bin/prettier\" ] && \"$dir/node_modules/.bin/prettier\" --write \"$filepath\" >/dev/null 2>&1 || true ;; *.dart) dart format \"$filepath\" >/dev/null 2>&1 || true ;; esac; exit 0"
        }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

2. Keep each child's own `.claude/settings.json` for single-project sessions (only that pack loaded, project-specific permissions).

**Rule of thumb:**
- Cross-project work → open from parent.
- Single-project work → open from child.
- `--add-dir` is for *reading* a sibling (e.g. "check the API controller"), not for editing it under its own rules.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Plugin not found"** — run `/plugin marketplace list`. If `pixelcrafts` isn't listed, the marketplace didn't register. For zero-config setups, try `/reload-plugins`.

**Standards aren't firing** — auto-invoke needs a matching file open. Editing a `.md` or just chatting won't trigger Flutter standards. Open a `.dart` file and try again.

**Skill names tokens that don't exist** — the skills detect your design-system class names by grepping `lib/shared/` (Flutter) or `components/` (Web). If they can't find them, they default to generic names (`AppColors`, `AppSpacing`). Drop a project `CLAUDE.md` line telling Claude your actual class names.

**Cursor / Antigravity changes don't appear** — the generated files are artifacts, not live imports. Re-run `scripts/export.sh` after pulling latest.
